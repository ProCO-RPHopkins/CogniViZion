# Project Mangement & Development

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration**:
    - Create a new directory for your project.
    - Set up a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`.
    - Install Flask and other necessary packages (`pip install flask`).

2. **Create Flask App and Basic Routes**:
    - Initialize a Flask app in your project directory.
    - Create a basic route (`/`) to display a welcome message.
    - Run the app locally to verify everything is working.

3. **Database Setup and Models**:
    - Choose a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
    - Define SQLAlchemy models for entities like User, StudyMaterials, Concepts, and Progress.

4. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Implement user registration and login routes.
    - Use Flask-Login for session management.
    - Create templates for registration, login, and user profile pages.

5. **Content Upload and Processing**:
    - Create a route for users to upload study materials (PDFs or text).
    - Process the uploaded content (extract text using libraries like `PyMuPDF` or `pdfminer`).
    - Store relevant data (e.g., content text, user ID) in the database.

6. **Test Style Selection and AI Interaction**:
    - Develop routes for users to choose their preferred learning styles.
    - Integrate AI prompts for personalized learning tool recommendations.
    - Implement logic for identifying different learning styles (color coding, pictures, etc.).

7. **Concept Identification and Question Generation**:
    - Use NLP libraries (e.g., `spaCy`, `NLTK`) to identify key concepts within uploaded content.
    - Allow users to manually identify concepts (via text input or voice).
    - Generate multiple choice questions, matching exercises, and other interactive content based on identified concepts.

8. **Progress Tracking and Feedback**:
    - Provide instant feedback on user answers (e.g., correct/incorrect).
    - Track cumulative study progress (store progress data in the database).
    - Suggest improvements and critical thinking questions once content is mastered.

9. **Additional Testing Tools and Collaboration Features**:
    - Implement additional testing tools (vocabulary quizzes, open-ended questions, etc.).
    - Allow users to explore related concepts beyond the test scope.
    - Enable study group formation, note sharing, and collaborative discussions.

10. **Adaptive Learning Path**:
    - Based on user performance and preferences, adjust the learning path dynamically.
    - Use machine learning techniques (reinforcement learning, recommendation systems) to personalize the experience.

11. **Frontend Development**:
    - Create HTML templates for different pages (registration, login, content upload, study tools, etc.).
    - Use Jinja2 templating to render dynamic content.
    - Style your app using CSS or a frontend framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.).

12. **Testing and Deployment**:
    - Write unit tests for your routes and functionality.
    - Deploy your app to a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
