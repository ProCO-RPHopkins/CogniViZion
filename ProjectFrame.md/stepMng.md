# Individual Step Management

## Step 2: Create Flask App and Basic Routes

1. Initialize a Flask App
    - In your project directory, create a new folder (e.g., study_group_app).
    - Inside this folder, create a Python file (e.g., app.py) to house your Flask application.
    - Initialize the Flask app by importing necessary modules and creating an instance:

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

2. Create a Basic Route
    - Define a route that responds to the root URL (/). This route will display a welcome message or a landing page.

        @app.route('/')
        def index():
            return "Welcome to Study Group! Your ed-tech platform for streamlined test preparation."

3. Run the App Locally
    - To test your app, run it locally on your development machine.
    - In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and execute: python app.py
    - You should see a message indicating that your Flask app is running (usually on <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>).

4. Verify Everything Is Working
    - Open a web browser and visit <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>.
    - You should see the welcome message you defined in the index route.
    - If everything looks good, congratulations! Your basic Flask app is up and running.

## Step 3: Database Setup and Models

1. Choose a Database
    - Decide on the database system you want to use (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    - Consider factors like ease of setup, scalability, and your familiarity with the system.
2. Install Necessary Packages
    - Install the required packages for database integration. For example, if you choose SQLite:
    - pip install flask-sqlalchemy

3. Define SQLAlchemy Models
    - Create a new Python file (e.g., models.py) in your project directory.
    - Define your data models using SQLAlchemy classes. For example:

        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

        db = SQLAlchemy()

        class User(db.Model):
            id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
            username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
            # Add other user-related fields (password hash, email, etc.)

        class StudyMaterials(db.Model):
            id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
            user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
            content_text = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
            # Add other fields (file path, metadata, etc.)

            # Define other models (Concepts, Progress, etc.) similarly (see stepTwoMng.md for details)

    - Set up relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) between models as needed.
4. Initialize the Database
    - In your app.py, initialize the database using the following steps:

        app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///study_group.db'  # Change to your chosen DB URI
        db.init_app(app)

        with app.app_context():
            db.create_all()

5. Test the Database Connection
    - Add some sample data to your models (e.g., create a user, upload study materials).
    - Use SQLAlchemy to interact with the database and verify that everything is functioning as expected.

## Step 4: User Authentication and Authorization

1. User Registration and Login Routes
    - Create routes for user registration and login.
        - For registration:
        - Collect user details (username, email, password).
        - Validate input data (e.g., check if the username is unique).
        - Hash and securely store the password (use libraries like bcrypt).
        - Save user data to the database.
    - For login
        - Validate user credentials (username/email and password).
        - Use Flask-Login to manage sessions (store user ID in the session).
        - Redirect authenticated users to their profile page.
2. Flask-Login for Session Management
    - Install Flask-Login: pip install flask-login
    - Initialize it in your app:

        from flask_login import LoginManager

        login_manager = LoginManager()
        login_manager.init_app(app)

    - Implement a user loader function to load users from the database based on their ID.
    - Use decorators (@login_required) to protect routes that require authentication.
3. Create Templates for Registration, Login, and User Profile
    - Design HTML templates for registration and login forms.
    - Include form fields (username, email, password) and submit buttons.
    - Create a user profile template to display user-specific information (e.g., uploaded materials, progress).

## Step 5: Content Upload and Processing

1. Create an Upload Route
    - Define a route (e.g., /upload) where users can submit study materials.
    - Create an HTML form with a file input field for users to upload PDFs or text files.
    - Handle the form submission in your route.
2. Process Uploaded Content
    - When a user uploads a file:
        - Check if the file is valid (allowed file types: PDF or text).
        - Save the file to a temporary location (e.g., tempfile.gettempdir()).
        - Extract text from the uploaded PDF (you can use libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfminer).
        - Store the extracted content in a variable (e.g., content_text).
3. Get User ID (Authentication Required)
    - You need to implement user authentication first.
    - Once a user is authenticated (logged in), retrieve their user ID.
    - For now, you can use a placeholder value (e.g., user_id = 1) until proper authentication is set up.
4. Save Content Text and User ID to the Database
    - Create a new record in the StudyMaterials table (defined in your SQLAlchemy models).
    - Associate the content text with the user who uploaded it (using their user ID).
    - Commit the changes to the database.

## Step 6: Test Style Selection and AI Interaction

1. Develop Routes for Learning Style Selection
    - Create routes (e.g., /learning_styles) where users can choose their preferred learning styles.
    - Consider offering options like visual (color coding, pictures), auditory (voice prompts), or kinesthetic (interactive exercises).
    - Store the selected learning style in the user’s session or database profile.
2. Integrate AI Prompts for Personalized Learning Tools
    - Use AI (natural language processing or recommendation systems) to prompt users.
    - For example:
        - “Based on your learning style preference, we recommend visual aids like color-coded study materials.”
        - “Would you like to explore interactive exercises or mnemonic techniques?”
        - Customize prompts based on the user’s chosen learning style.
3. Implement Logic for Learning Style Identification
    - Use predefined rules or machine learning models to identify learning styles.
    - Examples:
        - Color Coding: Analyze content and highlight key concepts with different colors.
        - Pictures: Automatically generate relevant images or diagrams based on identified concepts.
        - Funny Memorization: Suggest mnemonic devices or acronyms.
        - Journey Learning: Provide a structured learning path (e.g., step-by-step guides).
        - Flash Cards: Generate flashcards for memorization.

## Step 7: Concept Identification and Question Generation

1. Use NLP Libraries for Concept Identification
    - Choose an NLP library (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) to process the uploaded content.
    - Extract relevant terms, phrases, and concepts from the study materials.
    - For example:
        - Tokenize the text into words.
        - Identify named entities (e.g., important terms, dates, people).
        - Detect noun phrases or subject-verb-object relationships.
2. Allow Manual Concept Identification
    - Create a user interface (web form or voice input) where users can manually identify concepts.
    - Users can highlight or tag specific parts of the content as concepts.
    - Store these user-identified concepts alongside the automated ones.
3. Generate Interactive Content Based on Concepts
    - Use the identified concepts to create study materials:
        - Multiple Choice Questions: Frame questions related to the concepts.
        - Matching Exercises: Match concepts with their definitions or examples.
        - Memorization Exercises: Create flashcards or mnemonic aids.
        - Interactive Discussions: Engage users in concept-based discussions.

## Step 8: Progress Tracking and Feedback

1. Instant Feedback on User Answers
    - When users interact with study materials (e.g., answering questions, completing exercises), provide immediate feedback.
    - Indicate whether their answers are correct or incorrect.
    - Consider using color-coded indicators (green for correct, red for incorrect) or textual messages.
2. Cumulative Study Progress Tracking
    - Store user progress data in the database.
    - Track metrics such as:
        - Number of questions attempted
        - Correct answers
        - Time spent studying
        - Concepts mastered
    - Use this data to create visualizations (charts, graphs) for users to monitor their progress.
3. Suggest Improvements and Critical Thinking Questions
    - Once a user achieves a certain level of mastery (e.g., consistently answering correctly), prompt them with more challenging questions.
    - Encourage critical thinking by asking open-ended questions related to the concepts they’ve studied.
    - Provide hints or explanations for incorrect answers to facilitate learning.

## Step 9: Additional Testing Tools and Collaboration Features

1. Implement Additional Testing Tools
    - Offer a variety of testing formats beyond multiple choice questions:
        - Vocabulary Quizzes: Test users’ understanding of terminology.
        - Open-Ended Questions: Allow users to express their knowledge in their own words.
        - Essay Prompts: Encourage deeper exploration of concepts.
        - Gamified Learning: Create interactive games related to study materials.
2. Explore Related Concepts Beyond Test Scope
    - Provide links or references to related topics.
    - Suggest additional reading materials or resources.
    - Help users broaden their understanding beyond what’s directly tested (AI continues to ask questions and creates interactive discussions).
3. Enable Study Group Formation and Collaboration
    - Allow users to form study groups within the app.
    - Features:
        - Note Sharing: Users can share their study notes or summaries.
        - Generated Study Guides: Collaboratively create study guides based on identified concepts.
        - Concept Discussions: Enable group discussions around specific concepts.
        - Adaptive Learning Path for Groups: Adjust content recommendations based on group performance.

## Step 10: Adaptive Learning Path

1. Personalization Based on User Performance
    - Collect data on user interactions (e.g., correct answers, time spent on concepts).
    - Use this data to adapt the learning path:
        - If a user consistently answers questions correctly, gradually increase the difficulty.
        - If a user struggles with certain concepts, provide additional practice or explanations.
    - Implement reinforcement learning techniques to adjust content difficulty dynamically.
2. Recommendation Systems
    - Leverage recommendation algorithms to suggest relevant study materials:
        - Based on the user’s past interactions.
        - Considering their preferred learning style.
        - Taking into account concepts they’ve mastered or need more practice with.

## Step 11: Frontend Development

1. Create HTML Templates
    - For each page (registration, login, content upload, study tools, etc.), design HTML templates.
    - Use Jinja2 templating to inject dynamic content (e.g., user-specific data, study material details).
    - Example (Jinja2 syntax):
        HTML

        <h1>Welcome, {{ user.username }}!</h1>
        <p>Your progress: {{ user.progress }}%</p>

2. Style Your App
    - Use CSS or a frontend framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.) to make your app visually appealing.
    - Customize colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
    - Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Step 12: Testing and Deployment

1. Write Unit Tests
    - Create test cases for your routes, functions, and database interactions.
    - Test edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, unexpected behavior).
    - Use testing libraries (e.g., unittest, pytest) to automate testing.
2. Deploy App
    - Choose a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
    - Set up environment variables (database connection, secret keys).
    - Deploy app using the platform’s instructions.
    - Monitor logs and ensure everything is working in the live environment.
